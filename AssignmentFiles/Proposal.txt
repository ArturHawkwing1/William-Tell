Task: We intend to revamp the way that student interns enter in their hours on their time sheet.  The current system is:
1. Not mobile friendly
2. Forces the user to select AM or PM for everything
3. Forces the user to use 12 hour clock instead of letting them have the freedom to chose betten 12 hour and 24 hour clock
4. Combersome to get to
5. Only displays one week at a time when it's a biweekly pay system
6. Only allows employees to enter time in 15 minute incements
7. Bad design
8. And other reasons pertaining to peas.
